        Vipassana, which means to see things as they really are, 
        is one of India's most ancient techniques of meditation. 
        It was taught in India more than 2500 years ago as a universal 
        remedy for universal ills, i.e., an Art of Living. 
        For those who are not familiar with Vipassana Meditation, 
        an Introduction to Vipassana by Mr. Goenka & related videos 
        and Questions & Answers about Vipassana are available.
